# OpenGL-Game1-Fruits-vs-Vegetables
Fruits Vs Vegetables, that's the name of my first ever game using C++ on Visual Studio 2019. It took exactly 2 weeks. The idea of the game is like the very famous game cat vs dog but instead of a cat there is an apple and instead of a dog there is a carrot. The apple throws its seeds while the carrot throws its leaves. The game is when one of them loses all his health.
