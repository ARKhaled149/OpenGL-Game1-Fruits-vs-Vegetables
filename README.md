# OpenGL-Game1-Fruits-vs-Vegetables (Oct 2019)
Fruits Vs Vegetables, that's the name of my first ever game using C++ on Visual Studio 2019. It took exactly 2 weeks. The idea of the game is like the very famous game cat vs dog but instead of a cat there is an apple and instead of a dog there is a carrot. The apple throws its seeds while the carrot throws its leaves. The game is when one of them loses all his health.
There might be an error in running the project so take the code, audio files, etc., and test in some other file.
